To estimate gravity equations you need a square dataset including bilateral
flows defined by the argument \code{dependent_variable}, ISO codes or similar of type character
(e.g. \code{iso_o} for the country of origin and \code{iso_d} for the
destination country), a distance measure defined by the argument \code{distance}
and other potential influences (e.g. contiguity and common currency) given as a vector in
\code{regressors} are required.

All dummy variables should be of type numeric (0/1).
Make sure the origin and destination codes are of type "character".
If an independent variable is defined as a ratio, it should be logged.
The user should perform some data cleaning beforehand to remove observations that contain entries that
can distort estimates.
The functions will remove zero flows and distances.

containing a measure of
distance between all pairs of bilateral partners and bilateral variables that should
be taken as the independent variables in the estimation.
