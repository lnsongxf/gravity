\usage{
bvu(dependent_variable, distance, additional_regressors = NULL,
  income_origin, income_destination, code_origin, code_destination,
  robust = FALSE, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dependent_variable}{(Type: character) name of the dependent variable. This dependent variable is 
divided by the product of unilateral incomes such (i.e. \code{income_origin} and \code{income_destination}) 
and logged afterwards.}

\item{distance}{(Type: character) name of the distance variable that should be taken as the key independent variable 
in the estimation. The distance is logged automatically when the function is executed.}

\item{additional_regressors}{(Type: character) names of the additional regressors to include in the model (e.g. a dummy
variable to indicate contiguity). Unilateral metric variables such as GDP should be inserted via the arguments 
\code{income_origin} and \code{income_destination}. As country specific effects are subdued due to demeaning, no further unilateral variables apart from incomes can be added.

Write this argument as \code{c(contiguity, common currency, ...)}. By default this is set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{income_origin}{(Type: character) origin income variable (e.g. GDP) in the dataset.}

\item{income_destination}{(Type: character) destination income variable (e.g. GDP) in the dataset.}

\item{code_origin}{(Type: character) country of origin variable (e.g. ISO-3 country codes). The variables are grouped 
using this parameter.}

\item{code_destination}{(Type: character) country of destination variable (e.g. country ISO-3 codes). The variables are 
grouped using this parameter.}

\item{robust}{(Type: logical) whether robust fitting should be used. By default this is set to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{data}{(Type: data.frame) the dataset to be used.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{bvu}.}
}
\value{
The function returns the summary of the estimated gravity model as an
\code{\link[stats]{lm}}-object.

\description{
\code{bvu} estimates gravity models via Bonus vetus OLS with simple averages.
}
\details{
Bonus vetus OLS is an estimation method for gravity models
developed by \insertCite{Baier2009,Baier2010;textual}{gravity} using simple averages to center a
Taylor-series.

The \code{bvu} function considers Multilateral Resistance terms and allows to
conduct comparative statics. Country specific effects are subdued due
to demeaning. Hence, unilateral variables apart from \code{inc_o}
and \code{inc_d} cannot be included in the estimation.

\code{bvu} is designed to be consistent with the Stata code provided at
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/hiegravity/}{Gravity Equations: Workhorse, Toolkit, and Cookbook}
when choosing robust estimation.

As, to our knowledge at the moment, there is no explicit literature covering
the estimation of a gravity equation by \code{bvu} using panel data,
we do not recommend to apply this method in this case.
